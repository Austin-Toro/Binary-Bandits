# SmartBoard
SmartBoard is a modernized learning management system (LMS) designed to replace outdated and inefficient platforms like Blackboard. Our objective is to create a streamlined, user-friendly interface that enhances the workflow for both students and teachers, making it easier to manage assignments, track due dates, and organize coursework efficiently. Current competitors, such as Blackboard, suffer from poor user experience, slow performance, and cluttered interfaces, despite generating significant revenue from their subscription-based services. SmartBoard aims to solve these issues by introducing a more intuitive layout, enhanced organization features, and a seamless grading system. Our platform will offer clearly structured tabs for assignments with due dates, grades, along with a calendar, ensuring that users have easy access to the information they need without unnecessary complexity.
